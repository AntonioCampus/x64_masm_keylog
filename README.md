# x64_masm_keylog

# About
The code itself is a simple keylog that use windows hooks, however it has been entirely
written in x64 assembly (masm), just for fun and learn some x64 assembly stuff.
The code implements manual resolution of all apis by using api-hashing technique with ror13 hashing algorithm.
